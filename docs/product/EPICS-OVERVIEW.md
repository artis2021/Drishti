## 1. Epic Dependency Graph

The dependencies between epics represent the logical build order. Foundation epics must be established before ingestion, and search capability must precede generation.

## 2. Epic Breakdown Table

The estimation follows standard Fibonacci story points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) where 1 point represents a trivial task (e.g., adding an environment variable) and 13 represents a complex, multi-day component build.

## 3. Phased Implementation Roadmap

Work is scheduled across six progressive build phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Epics 01–02)
* **Objective**: Build a rock-solid, production-grade project scaffold with all plans, guidelines, and documentation approved.
* **Outputs**: Full workspace setup, CI workflows, docker-compose, and all design documents.

### Phase 2: Ingestion & Storage (Epics 03–05)
* **Objective**: Build the multi-modal parser engine to convert raw files into structured syntax trees and paragraph layouts, embedding them into Qdrant.
* **Outputs**: Tree-sitter parsers, layout-aware PDF extraction, dense+sparse vector database collections.

### Phase 3: Search & Generation (Epics 06–08)
* **Objective**: Construct the core RAG runtime—retrieving chunks, combining sparse/dense scores, re-ranking via Cohere, and generating streaming LLM answers.
* **Outputs**: Hybrid search algorithm, context builder, citation generation, streaming FastAPI router.

### Phase 4: Frontend UI & Advanced Traversal (Epics 09–10)
* **Objective**: Create the Next.js visual interface incorporating code highlighting, citations, and interactive dependency visualization (optionally using Neo4j).
* **Outputs**: Modern Web UI, Monaco Editor integrations, dependency mapping.

### Phase 5: Evaluation & Science (Epic 11)
* **Objective**: Run automated quality frameworks against a golden Q&A dataset to calculate precision, recall, and faithfulness.
* **Outputs**: Metrics reporting CLI, automated regression alerts, comparison charts.

### Phase 6: Polish & Deployment (Epic 12)
* **Objective**: Final package optimization, seeding script execution, deployment staging.
* **Outputs**: Docker production images, interactive seed scripts, public walkthroughs.

## 4. Cross-Epic Quality Standards

Every user story built must adhere to the quality standards defined in our [AGENTS.md](file:///Users/abhishek/Dev/Drishti/AGENTS.md) guide:
1. **100% Type Annotations**: Checked via `mypy`.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Unit tests must cover all logic, with mock integrations.
3. **Structured Commits**: Commits must follow conventional format: `feat(scope): message`.
4. **Link Integrations**: Any new source code file must be linked in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`.
